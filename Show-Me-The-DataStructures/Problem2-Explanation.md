In my solution for File Recursion I have used `list` data structure to store all the matching files and used the concept of recusion to recursively go into directories and get the matching files.

The time complexity this solution is O(m+n) where `m` is the no of directory and `n` is the no of file. Each file and directory is visited only ones using recursion.
