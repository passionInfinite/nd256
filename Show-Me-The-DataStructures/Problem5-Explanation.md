In this solution I have used Linked List Data structure to store the Blocks and each block is corresponding to Node which has all the information stored.

The time complexity of inserting a list of blocks is O(n) but after that we directly use tail pointer to insert new blocks so time complexity becomes O(1)
so overall the worst case time complexity is O(n) and Space Complexity also remains O(n)
