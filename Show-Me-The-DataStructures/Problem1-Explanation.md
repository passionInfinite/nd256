In my solution for LRU cache I have used below data structures:
    1. Dictionary - For storing the map of cache key and its corresponding value.
    2. Linked List - To maintain record of which key is recently used.

The time complexity for all the set related operations is `O(1)` and the space complexity is `O(n)` where n is the size of cache.
