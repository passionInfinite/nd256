In this solution I have used concept of recursion for traversing and find the users through groups of groups.

The time complexity for user lookup in any group is O(m + n) where `m` is the number of groups and `n` is the total number of users. The space complexity is also O(m+n) where `m` is the number of groups and `n` is the total number of users.
