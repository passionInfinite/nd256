We start by defining both min and max as the first value of the unsorted array. Then we iterate over the unsorted array and for each iteration we check if min > the current value then we replace min with the current value and for max, if max > the current value then we replace max with the current value. Once the iteration over the whole array is complete we return the tupple consisting of both (min, max)

The time complexity for this algorithm is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1) as it uses constant space.
